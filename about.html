      </div>
      <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher focusing on understanding surface greenhouse gas exchanges and investigating the interactions between land cover dynamics and the climate at regional to global scales.</p>

      <p>Throughout my training and career, I have been engaged in diverse research areas centred on global warming and sustainability.
      With an interdisciplinary background in experimental ecophysiology and process-based modelling, I aim to advance knowledge as well as tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation.</p>

      <p>I am currently based at the <a href="https://www.wyssacademy.org/" target="_blank">Wyss Academy for Nature</a> and affiliated with the <a href="https://www.climate.unibe.ch/index_eng.html" target="_blank">Climate and Environmental Physics</a> at the University of Bern. Our team, <a href="https://www.wyssacademy.org/research-innovation" target="_blank">Climate Scenarios for Sustainable Development</a>, works on addressing the impacts of land use and land management on the interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and climate.</p>
