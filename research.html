    <p>Throughout my training and career, I have been engaged in diverse research areas centred on global warming and sustainability.
    With an interdisciplinary background in experimental ecophysiology and process-based modelling, I aim to advance knowledge as well as tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation.</p>
